Hi, here, I'd like to share my experience for learning Cloud. A lot of folks want to take a closer look at Cloud, but in bachelor level of education, many universities don't have corresponding lectures. As a uni student but with some insights in the industry, I'd like to share my learning experiences. That's the main intention I create this repo.

A lot of people have reached out to me to ask the learnign path, and here it is:

People say that the troika of cloud computing are: Compute, Storage, and Networking. Therefore, ]the most important thing abouut cloud is the simple fundamental knowldge: Operating System, Computer Networking, Computer Architecture, Data structure and Algorithms, Security, and Distributed Systems.  I beg most universities have those lectures.

After you have a gooding understanding of those key foundamental concepts, it's time to learn the "tools", the specific technology. Start with Linux, then we move to Docker and container. After that, we can go to Kubernetes, a orchestration tools in multi-cluster. 

Then, it's important to learn a Cloud Platform (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure etc), after that, time to learn the Infrastructure as code (IaC) tool, Terraform.

Have fun. :)
