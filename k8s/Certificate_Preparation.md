## General Advice
### Learn for the exam
- Courses (CKA and CKAD are available on Udemy but CKS is only available in KodeKloud)  
  https://kodekloud.com/  
  
- Practice Environment (Pretty handy to use, and no need to set up a local environment anymore. And based on different exams, there are different setups. And it's FREE!)
